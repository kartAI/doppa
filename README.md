## Background

The management and distribution of Norwegian geospatial data is today largely based on classical technologies such as
database-driven services, WMS servers, and centralized platforms like **[GeoNorge](https://www.geonorge.no/)**. While
GeoNorge provides a platform
to distribute data from multiple organizations, it comes with several limitations:

- **Scalability**: Costs and complexity increase with usage.
- **Target audience**: Primarily designed for GIS professionals rather than developers who need access for analytics and
  application development.
- **Data ownership**: Each organization (e.g., Kartverket, Kystverket) manages its own systems, which must still be
  shared through common platforms. This often leads to **delays, outdated datasets, and inconsistent representations**
  of data.

At the same time, there is a growing need for **flexible, cost-efficient, and developer-friendly methods** of data
sharing.

The rapid development of **spatial cloud-native technologies** is opening doors to a paradigm shift. Initiatives like
**Overture Maps** — driven by Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft — are already processing **petabytes of geospatial data** at
unprecedented speed, largely due to their adoption of cloud-native architectures.

## Project Description

**doppa** explores how cloud-native technologies can be applied to Norwegian geospatial data while meeting key
requirements:

- **Scalability** – handling increasing volumes of geospatial data efficiently.
- **Developer-friendliness** – providing APIs and modern interfaces for application developers.
- **Interoperability** – enabling collaboration between different data owners and systems.
- **Single Source of Truth** – ensuring a reliable, up-to-date, and consistent representation of datasets.

A central part of the project is to:

- Identify which **cloud-native technologies** are best suited for Norwegian datasets.
- Explore how the **work of Overture Maps** can be adapted to a Norwegian context.
- Build a **technical prototype** to demonstrate the potential of this approach.

## Goals

- Reduce **latency, cost, and complexity** in accessing national geospatial data.
- Provide a **modern, developer-friendly platform** for spatial analytics and applications.
- Lay the groundwork for a **scalable and interoperable geospatial infrastructure** in Norway.
